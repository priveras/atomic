          <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>

          <p>We have deep knowledge and a lot of experience optimizing sites for Search Engines. You’ve probably heard about SEO before, but have you ever wondered, <spa class="
          text-primary">why is it imporant?</span></p>

          <p><b>What is SEO?</b></p>
          <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the practice of improving and promoting a website, in order to increase the number of (non-paid) visitors the site receives from search engines.</p>

          <p><b>Why is it important?</b></p>
          <p>Search is a high-intent channel. If you are a user on a search engine, you are actively looking for a solution to a problem. If your business is not found, it is losing revenue.</p>

          <p><b>Why does it matter?</b></p>
          <p>SEO matters because it’s a high intent marketing channel. That means that whoever is performing the search, is looking for an answer to a question, therefore the probability for conversion is much higher.</p>

          <p>Now that you understand the importance of SEO, it’s time to optimize your website and make sure that search engines will show the content to the relevant searchers. Contact us so we can help you win on Search</p>

          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Keyword Research</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>

          <p>It’s very important to understand your keyword strategy. Understand keywords that work for you and your brand. Build an assortment of keywords based on related searches by google. People who tended to search for mini cooper in the top states, also searched for gas prices. So they noticed that if they talk about fuel efficiency in the landing pages, the conversion was higher.</p>
